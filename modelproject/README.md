# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Modelproject and is based around the overlapping generations model (OLG model). The analysis is extended to include a tax directly levied on labour income and a tax on savings. Finally, the project is concluded, based on the evaluations taken throughout the project.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
