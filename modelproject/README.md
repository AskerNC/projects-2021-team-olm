# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Modelproject and is based around the overlapping generations model (OLG model). Firstly, the consumer's household problem is solved. We then derive the firm's maximising levels of wage rate and interest as well as the steady state level of capital. In addition, the analysis is extended to include a tax levied directly on labour income and a tax on savings. Finally, the project is concluded, based on the evaluations taken throughout the project.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
