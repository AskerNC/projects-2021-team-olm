# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Dataproject and explores the danish export to certain main trading partners in the period 2005-2019. The analysis is then taking further to include exports of specific goods and services in the same period.   

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. https://www.statistikbanken.dk/BB3
2. https://www.statistikbanken.dk/UHV3

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
